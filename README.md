# **Indic Voice Enabled Finance Assistant ðŸ”ŠðŸ“±**

## **Overview**
This application enables voice-to-voice interaction in three languages(English,Hindi and Tamil) on finance-related topics. It combines cutting-edge technologies like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Machine Translation (MT), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and external LLMs to provide accurate and context-aware responses for financial queries. 

![Application Overview](https://github.com/rounit57/Finance-assistance/blob/main/Flowchart-Puchho.jpg)

## **Key Features**
- **Voice-to-Voice Functionality**: Supports three Indian languages for a seamless interaction experience.
- **Finance-Specific Dataset**: Includes:
  - A **generated dataset** of 750 finance-related Q&A pairs covering 15 topics (50 questions per topic).
  - Scenario-based Q&A in English created via ChatGPT prompts.
  - **Private dataset** (now removed for compliance).
- **Custom RAG Pipeline**: 
  - Combines data inputs with external LLMs to generate accurate answers.
  - Ensures contextual relevance by using advanced retrieval and generation techniques.
- **Shabdh Tech Integration**: Leverages Shabdh Tech for:
  - **Text Analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER)**.
  - **Machine Translation (MT)** for Indic languages.
  - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** for natural voice output.
